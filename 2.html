            Innovative applications and contributions from the Wikidata community
            Featured WikiProject:
            WikiProject COVID-19.
            As the world combats the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,
            Wikidata has been extremely useful in collecting and modelling useful information related to COVID-19,
            from relevant research articles and clinical trials, to epidemiological statistics of various regions,
            to lexemes for words and phrases commonly associated with the pandemic, and much more.
            A lot of work from WikiProject COVID-19 goes into creating and maintaining these items,
            bolstering Wikidata's role as a helpful open resource in the pandemic.
