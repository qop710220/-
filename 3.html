        <h3>Relationship with Java</h3>
        JavaScript has nothing to do with Java except that it has the same syntax as C. Netscape developed JavaScript, and Sun Microsystems developed Java. The remainder of this section assumes a background in programming. If you prefer, you can skip to the next section.

Variables have static types (such as integers or strings) that remain the same for the lifetime of the program running in Java, and dynamic types (such as Number or String) that can change over the lifetime of the running program in JavaScript. Variables must be declared before use in Java and have values when referenced before being assigned in JavaScript. undefined

JavaScript engines can implement functionality beyond the ECMAScript language standard, such as the essential features provided by V8 or the document object model found in many web browsers.

Java contains classes and object instances, and JavaScript uses prototypes.</p>
