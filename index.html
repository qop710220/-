    <h2>WEB</h2>
        <p>Multiple web resources with a common theme and usually a common domain name make up a website.
             A single web server may provide multiple websites, while some websites, especially the most popular ones, may be provided by multiple servers.
              Website content is provided by a myriad of companies, organizations, government agencies, 
              and individual users; and comprises an enormous amount of educational, entertainment, commercial, and government information.

            The World Wide Web has become the world's dominant software platform.[2][3][4][5] It is the primary tool billions of people worldwide use to interact with the Internet.[6]
            
            The Web was invented by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in 1989 and opened to the public in 1991. It was conceived as a "universal linked information system".</p>
